Description: 
        This module contains two extensions needed for pybliographer:
        
           - a bibtex parser
           - a simple binding to GNU Recode
        
        It requires the following libraries to be installed:
        
           - Glib-2.0 (and its development headers)
           - GNU Recode 3.5 (and its development headers)
